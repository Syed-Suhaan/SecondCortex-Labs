# SecondCortex

**Your AI-Powered Second Brain for Development Context**

SecondCortex is a VS Code extension designed to capture and resurrect your development state. It tracks your IDE activity, enforces a Semantic Firewall to protect sensitive data, and allows you to "resurrect" complex workspace setups with a single command.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Workspace Resurrection Engine**: Restore branch context, stashes, open files, and terminal intent in one flow.
- **Live Context Capture**: Continuously snapshots editor and terminal activity with debounce and noise filtering.
- **Secure-By-Default Pipeline**: Semantic Firewall redacts keys, passwords, and sensitive tokens before sync.
- **Cortex as a Service (MCP)**: Expose your personal Cortex Memory to external AI tools through Model Context Protocol.
- **SecondCortex Sidebar Chat**: Ask architecture or project-history questions directly inside VS Code.
- **Session History + New Chat**: Quickly revisit prior conversations or start clean context threads.
- **Shadow Graph Panel**: Open the visual context graph to inspect relationships across captured work.
- **Safe Authentication Layer**: Login state uses VS Code SecretStorage for encrypted local token handling.
- **CLI + Command Palette Support**: Trigger core actions from slash commands, extension commands, or terminal CLI.

## 🧠 Cortex as a Service (MCP)

SecondCortex is not only an extension UI. It also powers an MCP endpoint from the backend so other AI assistants can query your private development memory.

What MCP adds:

- Reuse the same memory graph outside VS Code chat.
- Query historical snapshots semantically from MCP-compatible clients.
- Keep memory access scoped and authenticated with MCP API keys.

MCP is served by the backend and exposes tools like `search_memory` for context retrieval across files, branches, and snapshots.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

1. **Install** the extension from the VS Code Marketplace.
2. **Log In** via the SecondCortex sidebar icon in the Activity Bar.
3. **Capture**: Work naturally. SecondCortex captures snapshots in the background.
4. **Resurrect**: 
   - Type `/resurrect latest` in the SecondCortex Chat.
   - Or run `cortex resurrect latest` in your terminal.

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

SecondCortex is designed with a "Privacy First" approach. Our **Semantic Firewall** ensures that API keys, passwords, and other PII are redacted locally before any data is sent to the backend.
